# Description: 
All the images of CHEESE-IDB depict cheese wheels, acquired by an Italian cheese-making company (Lattebusche-Conad), 
centered on cardboard with a single light source, and they all share the same resolution of 6016x4016 pixels. 
The images are hierarchically categorized. First, the first level represents three different cheese products:
 - Semi-Hard;
 - Hard;
 - Extra-Hard.
The second level represents two different ripeness classes for each of the first level products:
 - Target represents cheese wheels with adequate ripeness;
 - Not Target represents cheese wheels that require additional aging or have exceeded the target ripeness.
